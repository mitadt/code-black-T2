This project is a browser extension which uses supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms
to test whether the given website is a malicious/phishing or safe to use.
In unsupervised learning, it checks 22 features of the URL to test for abnormalities.
In supervised learning, the URL is compared to the predefined dataset for result.
To run, we add the extension as a plugin and click on the icon to check the security of site.
